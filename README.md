## External API for RV generator
Since there are no compatible libraries that can generate random variable with Poisson and Exponential distribution in Swift. We are creating an API that will return a random variable for specific distribution. So to be able to compile and run this iPad app you need to also run the API on your local machine. [GitHub repository for Random Variable Generator API](https://github.com/Steven2110/DistributionGenerator) follow all the instructions mentioned in the `README.md` file and then compile and run this project.
